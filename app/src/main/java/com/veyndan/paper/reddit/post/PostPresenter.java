        //  ANS This functions is defined recursively, so the first time this is called outside
        //      itself is actually all the nodes that the Reddit feed is showing. When called
        //      recursively, it is kind of "appending to the back stack" of nodes. Moving this
        //      recursion to Reddit.java such that called reddit.subreddit(â€¦) will return every
        //      post in the subreddit. You limit it by using Observable#take. This is a feature
        //      which has been thought about before.
        //  ??? Should I be passing the ForestModel here or somewhere else? This is a cycle in
        //      MVI but calling it *Presenter is confusing.

        // TODO Must fix the below first as otherwise doing Observable.fromIterable(nodes) is

        //      here that would be true, otherwise at them moment iterating through all the trees
        //      would occur each page load instead of just the appended trees.
        //      Remember that you *may* have to think about it as 2d instead of 1d as the Observable
        //      shouldn't just be done one after the other, as sometimes children of a node is
        //      loaded, which is almost back in time, i.e. getting the comments of a post. Maybe,
        //      have to consider it as Observable<Observable> in the stream, but then won't it be
        //      Observable<Observable<Observable>> then Observable<Observable<Observable<Observable>>>
        //      as you go each node deeper. Remember getChildren() though is in node which is an
        //      Observable so kind of already defined? This is more that I don't have a full grasp
        //      of the system, so it needs to be understood and simplified i.e. recursion removal,
        //      potentially using subjects for triggers (though won't it be bidirectional then,
        //      which is against MVI cycles as they should be unidirectional?).
        //      Actually I haven't thought of it as 2d but it is 1d, that is why pagination of
        //      comments doesn't work. In preOrderTraverse method there is also recursion which
        //      is doing the 2d stuff, but none of them are coming back here to do recursive pagination
        //      here.
